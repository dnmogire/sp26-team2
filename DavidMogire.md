## About Me
Hi everyone! My name is David Mogire. I’m a Computer Science junior. I enjoy learning new technology, working on programming projects, and improving my skills.

## My CSC340 Goals
In CSC340, I want to improve my teamwork and software development skills. I also want to get better at using GitHub and version control so I can work on real projects more confidently.
